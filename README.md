# mealops

Welcome to MealOps, a meal planning application designed to help you plan your meals for the week using AI. This app will be available on both mobile and web platforms. It will feature a variety of recipes, some sourced from the internet and some contributed by users. The AI will take into account the nutritional values of the meals to create a balanced meal plan for each week.

## Vision

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my programming and DevOps skills. MealOps will leverage the latest DevOps technologies, including:

- **Cloud**: Deploying the application on cloud platforms.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Docker**: Containerizing the application for consistent environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating containers for scalability and reliability.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using tools like Terraform.
- **ArgoCD**: Implementing GitOps for continuous delivery.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Ensuring the application's health and performance.

The more tools and technologies we can incorporate, the better!

## Features

- **Recipe Database**: A collection of recipes from the internet and user submissions.
- **AI Meal Planning**: Using AI to plan balanced meals for the week.
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Taking into account the nutritional values of meals.
- **Mobile and Web Support**: Accessible on both mobile devices and web browsers.

Stay tuned for more updates as we build this application together!
